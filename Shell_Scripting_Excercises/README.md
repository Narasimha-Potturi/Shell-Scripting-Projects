# Shell Scripting Excercises

**People who wants to get started with _shell scripting_ and practise few examples these excercises are helpful for them to start with**

**Please try to attempt these excercises and then check the actual for better understanding**

The List of excercises covered here are
* Excercise-1:  _Addition of two numbers taken from user_
* Excercise-2:  _Age Checker that asks the user for their age and then tells them if they are an adult (18 or older) or a minor_
* Exercise-3:   _Simple Calculator_

The problem statement and other instructions are given clearly inside the excercise file. 


# Some common issues with GIT

## Git Push Rejected â€“ Non-Fast-Forward Error

## **Problem Statement**

When pushing changes to a remote GitHub repository, you might encounter the following error:

```
To https://github.com/Narasimha-Potturi/Shell-Scripting-Projects.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Narasimha-Potturi/Shell-Scripting-Projects.git'

```


### **When does this happen?**
- You made changes directly on GitHub (e.g., added/edited files in the web UI).
- Your local branch doesn't have those remote changes.
- Git blocks your push to **prevent overwriting remote commits** unintentionally.

---

### **Objective**

Synchronize your local branch with the remote branch **safely**, preserving both sets of changes and avoiding messy commit history.

---

### **Recommended Solution: `git pull --rebase`**

The cleanest and safest solution is to rebase your local changes on top of the remote changes.

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Pull remote changes with rebase:**

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```
2. **Resolve conflicts (if any):**

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```
   * Edit the conflicted files manually.

   * Stage resolved files:

   ```bash
   git add <filename>
   ```
   * Continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```
   * Push your changes to remote:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Understanding Rebase

When you run

`git pull --rebase origin main`

Git performs:

1.Fetch remote commits from origin/main.

2.Temporarily removes your local commits.

3.Applies remote commits first.

4.Reapplies your local commits on top of them.

This way, your local work always builds on top of the latest version of the remote branch.
